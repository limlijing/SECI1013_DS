This course introduces students to the principles and applications of discrete structure in the field of computer science. 
I able to use set theory, relations and functions to solve computer science problems, analyze and solve problems using recurrence relations and counting methods, apply graph theory and trees in real world problems and use deterministic finite automata finite state machines to model electronic devices and problems.

## Assignment 1
In this assignment, I can solve the question of operation set.This assignment improve my deeper in operation set.

## Assignment 2
Through this assignment, I learn more deep into combinational.
